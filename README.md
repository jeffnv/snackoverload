***snackoverload***

*snackoverload* is a clone of the primary features of stackoverflow, 
but about food! Like the originial, *snackoverload* is made of questions, answers
votes, tags, and comments. I don't intend on implementing the non-essential 
features like chat, but the main stuff should be there. Hopefully. 

_Stay hungry, everybody_ :)
